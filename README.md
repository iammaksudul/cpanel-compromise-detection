# cpanel-compromise-detection
This script scans all cPanel accounts on your server to detect potential signs of compromise. It checks Apache logs, PHP files, .htaccess files, and SSH login attempts for suspicious activity. It also monitors WHM login attempts for unauthorized access. If any unusual activity is detected, it flags the account as potentially compromised.
